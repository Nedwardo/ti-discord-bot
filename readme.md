Things to add:
Any git push to the repo will destroy the existing table (Maybe on railway I can just add the data to .gitignore?)
Autocomplete for factions is slow
1. Any git push to the repo will destroy the existing table (Maybe on railway I can just add the data to .gitignore?)
2. Autocomplete for factions is slow
3. Leaderboard with no data causes crash
4. Leaderboard on mobile looks like ass, should add an option to show less data (or show on sheets (it has an api))
5. Would like to containerise my deployment, but this should be good for now
6. I would like to backup my data every so often

Now hosting on [cloudflare](https://ti-discord-bot.edwardbo123.workers.dev)


Still to fix:
Autocomplete is bugged
leaderboard is bugged
more logging (output logs to disc?)
